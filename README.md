# GX-Assessment

*Notes for reviewers*

As I interpreted the intent of the assignment, I kept the tutorial scoped to the basics of "How to create, populate, and start a Sprint in Jira". I did not include anything else from the video, such as creating and managing projects, boards, or epics, or managing issues within a sprint. I chose not to include any screenshots as they did not seem necessary. The Jira interface is pretty friendly, and learning the locations of those buttons is a basic Jira skill.
