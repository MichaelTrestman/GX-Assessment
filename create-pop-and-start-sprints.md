# How to create, populate, and start a Jira sprint

A sprint is a period of time, typically a few weeks, in which your team will focus on completing a predefined set of goals, which are specified in *issues*. You can plan your team's work over time by creating one or more sprints and populating them with issues. Starting a sprint communicates to your team that the tasks described in the issues are ready for their attention over the duration of the sprint.

This page will guide you through the steps to create, populate, and start a sprint in a Jira project.

For a more in-depth discussion of how to plan and manage Jira sprints over time, refer to [Planning sprints](./jira-sprint-planning-guide.html).

## Prerequisite knowledge
- Basic understanding of [Jira issues](./learn-jira-issues.html).
- Familiarity with Agile methodology.
   *Tip:* Start with our introductory module, [Agile 101](./agile-101.html).
## Other prerequisites
- Access to a Jira account with sufficient permissions to Administer Projects. See [Managing project permissions](./manage-project-permissions.html).
- A backlog full of Issues that you are ready to organize. See [How to create Jira issues](./how-to-issues.html).

## Create a sprint

1. Navigate to your project in Jira.
2. Click on `Backlog` in the left-hand menu under `Planning`.
3. Click the `Create sprint` button. This will add a new sprint section at the top of your backlog.
   *Tip:* In a new project, you will see a blank sprint created by default, which you can use instead.

*Note:* You can create multiple sprints in your backlog to plan ahead, but only one can be *started* at a time. 

## Populate the sprint

1. In the `Backlog` view, find the issues you want to add to your sprint.
2. Drag and drop issues from the backlog into the new sprint.
3. Ensure the sprint has a balanced workload by checking the total story points or other estimates.

## Start the sprint

***Warning*: Starting a sprint will move all issues into an active state, which may notify team members who are referenced in the issues. Ensure that all team members are ready to begin the sprint to avoid miscommunication.**

1. Once your sprint is populated with issues, click the `Start sprint` button.
2. A dialog will appear, asking you to set the sprint details:
   - `Sprint name`: Enter a meaningful name for your sprint.
   - `Duration`:  Define the duration of your sprint. Typically, sprints last for 2-4 weeks.
   - `Start date` and `End date`:
   - `Sprint goal`: Describe the main objective of the sprint.
3. Click `Start` to complete the dialog and begin the sprint.

## Next steps

Now that you can create, populate, and start sprints, follow up by learning how to:
- Monitor sprint progress and manage your active sprints view. For more information, refer to [Managing active sprints](./managing-active-sprints.html).
- Review and close issues as they are completed. See [Managing the issue lifecycle](./issue-lifecycle-guide.html).
